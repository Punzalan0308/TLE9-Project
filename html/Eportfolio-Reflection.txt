<b>      As the 1st Quarter ends, it's very exciting and nerve wracking to discover what's next in my journey as a Grade 9 student. I have learned many things this quarter,<br>
from learning proper coding to inserting hyperlinks, I'm surprised to find myself wanting to learn more, and being interested in the topics.<br>
I feel like the topic that I quickly got the hang of was  about HTML Forms, because I was very interested about the fact that you can create forms in HTML.<br>
The lesson that I got a bit confused with was about the HTML Tables, because I lacked in review and experience, which I deeply regret not fully learning about it,<br>
but now I kind of get it. Unfortunately I'm not that interested in this particular subject, due to the fact that I don't want to go to this path for my career,<br>
but I know many people who would love learning this for their future jobs and experiences. Before I close my reflection, I would like to thank all the<br>
people who supported and helped me throughout this quarter, especially our lovely, Mrs. Uminga, I appreciate all the hard work and effort that you have given<br>
us to teach us and make us knowledgeable about coding and using it properly, thank you so much. That is all, and see you next Quarter!
